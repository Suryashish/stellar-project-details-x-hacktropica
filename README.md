# Stellar Soroban Smart Contract Projects

A collection of 35 Soroban smart contract projects with React frontends. Each project folder contains a ready-to-use contract, stellar.js helper, and React UI.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Google Chrome browser
- A GitHub account

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1 -- Clone the repo and set up a fresh project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suryashish/base-project-stellar-x-Hacktropica my-stellar-app
cd my-stellar-app
```

Remove the existing git history and start fresh:

```bash
rmdir /s /q .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This base project already includes the starter setup, so there is no separate dependency-install step in this guide.

### Step 2 -- Pick a project and copy the code

Open this repository in your browser to browse all the project folders (01 through 39). Pick the project you want to build.

Each project folder has this structure:

```
XX-project-name/
  contract/contract.rs     <-- Smart contract code
  frontend/app.jsx         <-- React component
  frontend/app.css         <-- Styles
  lib.js/stellar.js        <-- Stellar SDK helper
```

Copy the contents of each file into your Vite project:

1. Copy the content from `frontend/app.jsx` and paste it into `src/App.jsx` in your project
2. Copy the content from `frontend/app.css` and paste it into `src/App.css` in your project
3. Create a folder `src/lib/` and copy the content from `lib.js/stellar.js` into `src/lib/stellar.js`

### Step 3 -- Fix the imports in App.jsx

Open `src/App.jsx` and make these two changes at the top of the file:

1. Change the stellar.js import path from `"../lib.js/stellar.js"` to `"../lib/stellar.js"`
2. Add this CSS import line at the top: `import "./App.css";`

### Step 4 -- Install the Freighter wallet

1. Open this link in Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/freighter/bcacfldlkkdogcmkkibnjlakofdplcbk?hl=en-GB&utm_source=ext_sidebar
2. Click **Add to Chrome** and install the extension
3. Open the Freighter extension and click **Create New Wallet**
4. Enter a password and remember it
5. On the next page about the seed phrase, click **Do this later**

### Step 5 -- Switch to Testnet and fund your wallet

1. Click the Freighter extension icon to open it
2. Click the **globe icon** in the top-left corner
3. Select **Testnet**
4. Click **Fund with Friendbot** -- this gives you free test XLM

### Step 6 -- Deploy your smart contract

1. Open https://app.stacyide.xyz/ in your browser
2. Click **Connect** in the top right
3. Click **Connect Wallet** -- a Freighter popup will appear, click **Connect / Approve**
4. Click **Continue with Google** and sign in with your Google account
5. Reload the page
6. Click **Generate** -- you will see a code editor with a sample hello world contract
7. Select all the sample code and **delete it**
8. Open the `contract/contract.rs` file from your chosen project folder
9. Copy that contract code and **paste it** into the Stady editor
10. Click **Build Contract** and wait for it to finish
11. Click **Deploy to Testnet**
12. A modal will appear -- click **Confirm**
13. Enter your Freighter password if asked
14. Another modal will appear -- click **Confirm** again
15. You will get a **Contract ID** -- copy it

### Step 7 -- Configure your project with the Contract ID and wallet address

1. Open `src/lib/stellar.js` in VS Code
2. Find the line `export const CONTRACT_ID = "";` and paste your Contract ID between the quotes
3. Find the line `export const DEMO_ADDR = "";` -- you need your wallet address for this:
   - Open the Freighter extension
   - Click on **Account 1**
   - Click the **three dots** on the right
   - Click **Copy Address**
4. Paste your wallet address between the quotes for `DEMO_ADDR`

### Step 8 -- Run your app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173). Your app is now running and connected to your deployed smart contract on the Stellar testnet.

### Step 9 -- Polish your project for submission

1. **Improve the UI** -- Style your app, add a landing page / hero section that explains what the project does
2. **Create a README.md** -- Add a `README.md` file in your project root with:
   - Project title and description
   - Screenshots of your running app (save them in a `screenshots/` folder and embed them in the README using `![screenshot](screenshots/home.png)`)
   - The deployed contract ID and a link to it on Stellar Expert, e.g. `https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/YOUR_CONTRACT_ID`
   - Setup instructions so others can run your project
3. **Commit and push** your final changes

## Troubleshooting

- **Wallet not connecting** -- Make sure Freighter is installed, you are on Testnet, and you allowed site access
- **Read simulation fails** -- Check that `CONTRACT_ID` and `DEMO_ADDR` are filled in `stellar.js`
- **Transaction rejected** -- Make sure your wallet has test XLM (fund with Friendbot) and is on Testnet
- **Method not found** -- Make sure the function names in `stellar.js` match your deployed contract
